## Notes & Errata

- MTA train signs list their destination next to the line-name. This changes dynamically if there is track maintinence. However I was not able to find an online resource w . So i went with uptown/downtown station names exracted from [stops.txt](./resources/stops.txt). Labels for the first and last station can be found in the [line_ends](./resources/line_ends.txt) file
